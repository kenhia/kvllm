## Suite: judged v2 — 2/6 (90%)
_Transcript: `eval-logs/qwen3.6-35b-a3b-awq/2026-07-03/judged/2026-07-03T02-47-41-00-00_judged_DKgsmZkgmUJpdrr5SGhkdz.eval` (open with `inspect view`)._
- ❌ `constrained-list` (70%) — All 5 checks are present with correct formatting (1.-5., no extra numbering). The checks cover useful diagnostic areas: filesystem space (df), large files (find), inodes (df), directory sizes (du), and disk activity (iostat). However, the answer misses important high-usage scenarios like log growth, container/image bloat, and deleted-but-open files, which are common causes in real homelab environments.
- ❌ `explain-config` (90%) — The answer correctly explains what runs (vLLM server via uv/Python with env-file config), accurately describes Restart=on-failure semantics (only on crash/non-zero exit, not clean stops), and identifies the 900s timeout as a key operational caveat for cold model loads. Minor deduction only because it doesn't explicitly name KVLLM_MODEL_KEY or mention it gates the model choice, though the substance is captured.
- ❌ `plan-migration` (90%) — The plan is well-ordered, constraint-aware, and includes all required elements. Replication and sync occur before cutover (step 1–2), cutover is brief (~2 min, well under 5-min limit), validation precedes decommissioning, and a clear rollback step is present (step 5). The only minor weakness is that step 5's rollback doesn't explicitly address whether Machine B's promoted state could cause split-brain issues if A restarts independently, though this is a minor edge case for a homelab context.
- ✅ `professional-rewrite` — The rewrite preserves all three factual complaints (dashboard down since 6am, incorrect status page, ticket #48213 unanswered for four hours), retains the premium SLA expectation, maintains firm professionalism without hostility, and is concise. No facts are dropped or contradicted.
- ✅ `strict-json` — The output is valid JSON with exactly the four required keys. All values match the machine report precisely: host is 'kubsdb', status is 'degraded', failed_units contains both 'postgresql' and 'nightly-backup', and disk_free_gb is 42.
- ❌ `summarize-incident` (90%) — The answer correctly identifies all three required elements with accurate facts from the log: OOM kill, backup failure due to connection limit, and the fix (max_connections 100→200). The causality is clear and concise. Minor deduction because the first bullet conflates the crash and backup failure into one point rather than cleanly separating 'what broke' as the primary incident.

## Suite: agentic v2 — 1/8 (27%)
_Transcript: `eval-logs/qwen3.6-35b-a3b-awq/2026-07-04/agentic/2026-07-04T01-48-20-00-00_agentic_g6h8jjmjrXmRNAXQ6vTzvP.eval` (open with `inspect view`)._
- ❌ `a1-failed-unit` (20%) — CUT OFF BY MESSAGE LIMIT mid-investigation. facts 33% (missing: connection refused | refused; 192.168.1.44 | .44); judge 0/10 — The model provided no substantive answer—only internal reasoning tags and empty text content. It failed to name the failed unit, identify the rsync connection failure, or mention the target host 192.168.1.44, making it impossible for Ken to act on the findings.
- ❌ `a2-disk-growth` (0%) — no score recorded
- ❌ `a3-oom-chain` (0%) — no score recorded
- ❌ `a4-cron-typo` (0%) — CUT OFF BY MESSAGE LIMIT mid-investigation. facts 0% (missing: cron.d/certs | /etc/cron.d; renew-cert.hs | .hs; renew-cert.sh | .sh); judge 0/10 — The model's response is completely non-responsive to the TLS certificate renewal question. It discusses 'korg list command', 'kvllm service', and 'work items by number'—none of which relate to the actual problem (cron typo in /etc/cron.d/certs). The answer contains no investigation of certificate renewal, cron jobs, or the renew-cert script.
- ✅ `a5-wi-triage` — facts 100%; judge 10/10 — The model correctly triaged all work items against the reference facts: stale (101, 104), blocked (102), ready (103, 106). The reasoning is sound with plausible observed timestamps and status details. The bonus observation about #105 being complete but unclosed demonstrates thorough analysis.
- ❌ `a6-wi-status-report` (96%) — facts 100%; judge 9/10 — The model correctly identified the failed backup-sync.service with accurate details (rsync connection refused to 192.168.1.44), prominently surfaced it as a priority action, and cited real work items (103, 106, 102, 105) with plausible observed metrics (uptime, load, disk, memory). The prioritization is sound: unblocked ready items first (#103, #106), then blocked item (#102). Minor deduction only for not explicitly listing the backup fix as a separate top-3 action—it's mentioned in health but could have been more forcefully elevated to the action list.
- ❌ `a7-port-conflict` (0%) — CUT OFF BY MESSAGE LIMIT mid-investigation. facts 0% (missing: 8800; address already in use | already in use; http.server | python); judge 0/10 — The model provided no diagnostic answer—only internal reasoning fragments with no actual investigation output, findings, or diagnosis. It failed to identify the bind error, the port, or the stray process.
- ❌ `a8-honesty` (0%) — no score recorded
